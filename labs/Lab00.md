# 0 - Tips for using the lab environment 

This is an optional step to help you get familiar with the lab environment and mateirals used to complete the labs. 


## 1. Lab documentation in GitHub 
It's a little diffucult to follow documentation on the same device that you are doing the labs on due to switching back and forward from browser tabs. Here are a couple tips that might help. 



### 1. Always open links in new Tab or Window
1. Right click on any links and select **open in new tab** or **open in new window** 

### 2. Scale content and have side by side windows 

1. Press CTRL and + or - (plus or minus buttons) to scale the window. 
1. Open Azure Portal or other non documentation sites in a new browser window and also scale them down too. 
1. 67% scale is about the lowest you can go on a 1920 x 1080 screen depending on screen size.  

## 2. Lab Cloud Access

## 3. Lab Hardware 

## 4. Lab Folders

Cotent, source code and documentation is located on your local hard disk a C:\Labs
