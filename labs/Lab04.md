# Lab 4 â€“ Processing Data at the edge with Azure Stream Analytics

This lab introduces Azure Stream Analytics with Azure IoT Edge on Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.

## 1 - Deploy Simulated Temperature Sensor

### 1.1 - Module deployment using Azure CLI

1. Open the Start Menu and type **PowerShell**, then click **Run as Administrator**\
2. Login to Azure CLI using the following command:

**Note:** You may be asked to login to your browser; use your lab credentials
```powershell
az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
az login
```
3. Set your account to the correct subscription:
```powershell
az account set --subscription 'MSIoTLabs-IIA'
```
4. Run the following command replacing **[device id]** and **[hub name]** with their respective fields (found in the IoT Hub set up in Lab 3):
```powershell
az iot edge set-modules --device-id [device id] --hub-name [hub name] --content "C:\Labs\Content\src\IoTLabs.IoTEdge\deployment.example.win-x64.json"

#NOTE - entries are case sensitive and must be exactly the same as in the Azure port. Also make sure to remove the square brackets above, for example:
#az iot edge set-modules --device-id labuser01 --hub-name msiotlabs-iia-user01-iothub --content "C:\Labs\Content\src\IoTLabs.IoTEdge\deployment.example.win-x64.json"
```

### 1.2 - Verify Deployment on IoT Edge Device
The module deployment is instant, however changes to the device can take around 5-7 minutes to take effect. This means it can take a while for the new container to be loaded. The following commands can be used to check the status of the SimulatedTemperatureSensor container:

1. To validate the Azure IoT Edge runtime installation, continue within PowerShell and use the command:
```powershell
iotedge check
``` 

2. Run the following PowerShell command to see the current modules:
```powershell
iotedge list
```

3. Try running the following to see the logs from our simulated temperature sensor:
```powershell
iotedge logs SimulatedTemperatureSensor
```

Your device should be receiving simulated temperature data every 5 seconds with the machine temperature steadily rising.

### 1.3 - Monitor Device-to-Cloud messages
1. Enter the following command to monitor Device-to-Cloud (D2C) messages being published to the IoT Hub replacing **[device id]** and **[hub name]** with their respective fields from [step 1.1](#11---cloud-setup):
```powershell
az iot hub monitor-events --device-id [device id] --hub-name  [hub name]

#NOTE - make sure to remove the square brackets above, for example:
#az iot hub monitor-events --device-id device1 --hub-name  msiotlabs-iia-user06-iothub
```
2. The first time that you run this command, you are required to update a dependency by pressing **Y** then **enter**

This command will monitor the data being published into IoT Hub from the SimulatedTemperatureSensor container. It may take a while for data to start showing.

**Note:** Use Ctrl-C to stop monitoring as we will be doing more PowerShell commands soon.

## 2 - Configure Azure Stream Analytics Edge Job

### 2.1 - Navigate to your Azure Stream Analytics Edge Job
1. In the [Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)](https://portal.azure.com) open the **msiotlabs-iia-user##** resource group
2. Open the **Stream Analytics job** resource
![Stream Analytics Job](./media/lab04/asa-overview.jpg)

### 2.2 - Adding Inputs
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the stream analytics menu, select **Inputs**
2. Select **Add stream input**, then select **Edge Hub**
3. Set the **Input Alias** as **temperature** and leave the rest of the settings as default.
4. Click **Save**

### 2.3 - Adding Outputs
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the left hand menu, select **Outputs**
2. Select **Add**, then select **Edge Hub**
3. Set the **Output Alias** as **alert** and leave the rest of the settings as default.
4. Click **Save**

### 2.4 - Adding Query
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the left hand menu, select **Query**
2. Replace the existing Select statement with the one below:
```sql
SELECT  
    'reset' AS command,
    'lab04' AS source
INTO 
   alert 
FROM 
   temperature TIMESTAMP BY timeCreated 
GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second,30) 
HAVING Avg(machine.temperature) > 24
```

Stream Analytics can be used to enable complex logic on streams of data. This query is enabling our device to send a 'reset' message when the average temperature exceeds 24 degrees over 30 seconds.


3. Click **Save query**


## 3 - Configure IoT Edge to use Azure Stream Analytics Edge Job

### 3.1 - Module deployment using Azure Portal
1. In the [Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)](https://portal.azure.com) open the **msiotlabs-iia-user##** resource group
2. Open the **IoT Hub** resource, navigate to **IoT Edge** and then select the device created in [step 1.1](#11---cloud-setup)
![IoT Edge Devices](./media/lab04/iot-edge-devices.jpg)
3. Click **Set modules**
![Set Modules](./media/lab04/set-modules.jpg)
4. Under the **Deployment Modules** heading click **+ Add** and choose **Azure Stream Analytics Module**
![Adding ASA Module](./media/lab04/add-asa-module.jpg)
5. Set the Subscription as **MSIoTLabs-IIA** and Edge Job as **msiotlabs-iia-user##-streamanalytics**, then click **Save**

**Note:** You may have to click on the **Edge job** dropdown for the save button to show.

6. When the module has loaded, select **Configure** and take note of the **Name** field. You will be using this module name in the next step.
![Adding ASA Module](./media/lab04/configure-and-read-name.png)
7. Click **Save**, then **Next**

### 3.2 - Selecting the routes
1. Replace the current JSON with the following, substituting **[module name]** with the module name found in the previous step. There are 3 places that **[module name]** needs to be changed:

```javascript
{
    "routes": {
        "telemetryToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/* INTO $upstream",
        "alertsToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/[module name]/* INTO $upstream",
        "alertsToReset": "FROM /messages/modules/[module name]/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/inputs/control\")",
        "telemetryToAsa": "FROM /messages/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/[module name]/inputs/temperature\")"
    }
}
```
2. Select **Next**, then **Submit**

### 3.3 - Verify Deployment on IoT Edge Device
The module deployment is instant, however changes to the device can take around 5-7 minutes to take effect. Let's check that our device has loaded our Azure Stream Analytics module from the last step.

1. Open the Start Menu and type **PowerShell**, then click **Run as Administrator**\
2. Inspect the currently running modules using the following command:
```powershell
iotedge list
```
![List Modules](./media/lab04/list-modules.jpg)

3. Try running the following to see the logs from our simulated temperature sensor:
```powershell
iotedge logs SimulatedTemperatureSensor
```
You should see that the machine temperature increases until it reaches a temperature higher than the 24 degree threshold for at least 30 seconds.
![Temperature Reset](./media/lab04/temperature-reset.jpg)

4. When the SimulatedTemperatureSensor container stops producing data you can reset it to start over
```powershell
iotedge restart SimulatedTemperatureSensor
```


## 5 - Updating Existing IoT Edge Device Modules

    MAX(timeCreated) AS timeCreated,
    'lab04' AS source 
INTO 
   alert
FROM
     temperature TIMESTAMP BY timeCreated 
GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second,15) 
```

### 5.4 - Enable IoT Hub Routes

1. Return to your IoT Hub settings in the Azure Portal.
2. Click on 'Message Routing'
3. Choose the existing route and click 'Enable'
4. Save changes

This step will enable telemetry to flow into Time Series Insights which you can view from the common Resource Group.

## 6 - Azure Time Series Insights

### 6.1 - Visualise your data with Azure Time Series Insights (TSI)

These labs demonstrate how to collect, process and consolidate data from many different streaming sources into a single data platform. Azure Time Series Insights (TSI) allows mass collection and visualisation of time series data.

1. Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the 'common' Resource Group
![](./media/4_resources.png)
2. Click on the 'msiotlabs-iia-tsi' resource to view the TSI details
![](./media/4_tsi.png)
3. Click 'Go to environment' to navigate to the TSI dashboard
![](./media/__.png)
4. On the left column, look for your lab username and lab number. For example, "LAB.USER01 LAB04", click this device and choose 'Show temperature'
5. Explore the TSI environment by adjusting settings such as the timescale? needs some rewording on this one
