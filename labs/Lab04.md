## 2 - Deploy Simulated Temperature Sensor

### 2.1 - Module deployment using Azure CLI

1. Open the Start Menu and type **PowerShell**, then click **Run as Administrator**\
2. Login to Azure CLI using the following command:

**Note:** You may be asked to login to your browser; use your lab credentials
```powershell
az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
az login
```
3. Set your account to the correct subscription:
```powershell
az account set --subscription 'MSIoTLabs-IIA'
```
4. Run the following command replacing **[device id]** and **[hub name]** with their respective fields from [step 1.1](#11---cloud-setup):
```powershell
az iot edge set-modules --device-id [device id] --hub-name [hub name] --content "C:\Labs\Content\src\IoTLabs.IoTEdge\deployment.example.win-x64.json"

#NOTE - entries are case sensitive and must be exactly the same as in the Azure port. Also make sure to remove the square brackets above, for example:
#az iot edge set-modules --device-id labuser01 --hub-name msiotlabs-iia-user01-iothub --content "C:\Labs\Content\src\IoTLabs.IoTEdge\deployment.example.win-x64.json"
```


### 2.2 - Verify Deployment on IoT Edge Device
The module deployment is instant, however changes to the device can take around 5-7 minutes to take effect. This means it can take a while for the new container to be loaded. The following commands can be used to check the status of the SimulatedTemperatureSensor container:

1. To validate the Azure IoT Edge runtime installation, continue within PowerShell and use the command:
```powershell
iotedge check
``` 

2. Run the following PowerShell command to see the current modules:
```powershell
iotedge list
```

3. Try running the following to see the logs from our simulated temperature sensor:
```powershell
iotedge logs SimulatedTemperatureSensor
```

Your device should be receiving simulated temperature data every 5 seconds with the machine temperature steadily rising.

### 2.3 - Monitor Device-to-Cloud messages
1. Enter the following command to monitor Device-to-Cloud (D2C) messages being published to the IoT Hub replacing **[device id]** and **[hub name]** with their respective fields from [step 1.1](#11---cloud-setup):
```powershell
az iot hub monitor-events --device-id [device id] --hub-name  [hub name]

#NOTE - make sure to remove the square brackets above, for example:
#az iot hub monitor-events --device-id device1 --hub-name  msiotlabs-iia-user06-iothub
```
2. The first time that you run this command, you are required to update a dependency by pressing **Y** then **enter**

This command will monitor the data being published into IoT Hub from the SimulatedTemperatureSensor container. It may take a while for data to start showing.

**Note:** Use Ctrl-C to stop monitoring as we will be doing more PowerShell commands soon.

## 3 - Configure Azure Stream Analytics Edge Job

### 3.1 - Navigate to your Azure Stream Analytics Edge Job
1. In the [Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)](https://portal.azure.com) open the **msiotlabs-iia-user##** resource group
2. Open the **Stream Analytics job** resource
![Stream Analytics Job](./media/lab04/asa-overview.jpg)

### 3.2 - Adding Inputs
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the stream analytics menu, select **Inputs**
2. Select **Add stream input**, then select **Edge Hub**
3. Set the **Input Alias** as **temperature** and leave the rest of the settings as default.
4. Click **Save**

### 3.3 - Adding Outputs
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the left hand menu, select **Outputs**
2. Select **Add**, then select **Edge Hub**
3. Set the **Output Alias** as **alert** and leave the rest of the settings as default.
4. Click **Save**

### 3.4 - Adding Query
1. Under the **Job topology** heading in the left hand menu, select **Query**
2. Replace the existing Select statement with the one below:
```sql
SELECT  
    'reset' AS command,
    'lab04' AS source
INTO 
   alert 
FROM 
   temperature TIMESTAMP BY timeCreated 
GROUP BY TumblingWindow(second,30) 
HAVING Avg(machine.temperature) > 24
```

Stream Analytics can be used to enable complex logic on streams of data. This query is enabling our device to send a 'reset' message when the average temperature exceeds 24 degrees over 30 seconds.


3. Click **Save query**

### 4.2 - Selecting the routes
1. Replace the current JSON with the following, substituting **[module name]** with the module name found in the previous step. There are 3 places that **[module name]** needs to be changed:

```javascript
{
    "routes": {
        "telemetryToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/* INTO $upstream",
        "alertsToCloud": "FROM /messages/modules/[module name]/* INTO $upstream",
        "alertsToReset": "FROM /messages/modules/[module name]/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/inputs/control\")",
        "telemetryToAsa": "FROM /messages/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/* INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/[module name]/inputs/temperature\")"
    }
}
```
2. Select **Next**, then **Submit**

### 4.3 - Verify Deployment on IoT Edge Device
The module deployment is instant, however changes to the device can take around 5-7 minutes to take effect. Let's check that our device has loaded our Azure Stream Analytics module from the last step.

1. Open the Start Menu and type **PowerShell**, then click **Run as Administrator**\
2. Inspect the currently running modules using the following command:
```powershell
iotedge list
